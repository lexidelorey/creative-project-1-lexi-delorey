          <p>As a rule for these trips my parents take us on, we can't go to the same continent twice. So for
            my final trip, having already been to Europe and Asia, my options were basiclly South America or
            Africa. We got to see lots of elephants when I was in Thailand and my mom and I both loved them so
            much so Africa seemed like the best choice (no offense, South America, I'd love to go another time).</p>
          <p>The trip to South Africa was super long. an 8 hour flight to London, with a 12 hour layover, followed
            by a 11 hour flight to Cape Town. When we got there, we were all very tired and ready to take a rest.
            However, the day was just beginning when we arrived, and our tour guide was not about to allow us to waste
            any of our precious time, so out we went.</p>
          <p>Our first stio was the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. Holy cow, was it beautiful. This is my
            favorite picture from when we were there. This walkway was fairly new whe we got there, and it wrapped
            all around the most beautiful views of the park. The mountains surrounding the park were amazing, and the
            way the sun was hitting was just *chefs kiss* perfection. It was very interesting to see lots of flowers
            that we don't see in the US, and also get to see some cool animals, like an owl !!</p>
          <p>After this, we drove up to the lower observation point of Table Mountain. Unfotunately, the gondolas up the
            mountain were closed at that time, so we didn't get to go up the mountain. But even the view from the lower
            parking lot was amazing ! You can check that out in the gallery below.</p>
          <p>After dropping our stuff at the hotel, we headed out on a sunset cruise of the bay. In typical me fashion, I
            promptly fell asleep. Enjoy these photos that my parents took with me. They thought it was hilarious. I am sad
            I slept through this, thom because the sunset looked beautiful and my parents saw some dolphins and whales!</p>

          </div>
          <p>The next day we started off with another boat ride to see a ton of sea lions chilling on some rocks. If I am being
            totally honest, it smelled so bad. SO bad. And they were really loud and obnixious.
            Not to say I wish I hadn't seen it,
            it was still really cool. But I would probably be fine if I didn't see it again. However, we did get this really cute
            picture of me and my dad, so that made it all worthwhile :).</p>
          <p>Then we went on a long drive down the coast, stopping at a few beautiful lookout points, and making our way down to
            this super cool lighthouse on a hill. This stands as the most beautiful place I have ever been. The water was so blue,
            the walkways were all cobblestoney, the clifs were so dramatic. I honestly could have stayed here forever. It was a lot
            of walking and stair climbing, but it was totally worth it. Refer to the photo gallery for my pictures of this, there are
            just too many pretty ones to pick just one to go in the main article.</p>
          <p>Before heading out on our last day, we stopped to pet a cheetah and hold a meerkat. Petting the cheetah was way too
            scary, the picture of me doing it sends me every time because you can just SEE the fear in my eyes. Of course I am trying
            to smile bc that is what I do. The meerkat was way cuter, it was very sniffy and liked to crawl all over us, which tbh
            was kinda gross but also really fun.</p>
          <p>I'd say of all the places I've been, this is one of my favorites. Such a cool city with a lot of history and beautiful
            scenery. I would love to go back !! </p>
