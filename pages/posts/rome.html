          <p>When deciding where to go for my very first trip abroad, the choice was not even a question in my mind: Italy.
            I had always wanted to go, as I am a lover of all things Italian cuisine: pizza, pasta, lasagna, caprese salad,
            balsamic vinegar (that's a big word for Elmo) I could honestly go on and on and on... Not to mention I have always
            been a ~bit~ of a history buff, so getting to see tons of beautiful ancient architecture and art sounded like a dream
            come true.</p>
          <p>Rome was the first stop on our trip, and what a great way to start that was! Our very first Italian experience was in
            a taxi, which let me tell you was terrifying. The roads there are very narrow and the people drive like they don't care
            if they live to see another day. As a not-quite-yet-but-would-be-in-48-hours 16 year old who wouldn't end up getting her
            licence for another 2 months after her birthday, I think this experience was a little too much.</p>
          <p>The view from our hotel was amazing ! We had a beautiful little balcony to sit in and watch all the traffic and
            commotion down below. Despite my best efforts, I ended up taking a little nap from 5-7, and then it was time to
            start exploring ! We had our big plans the next day, so we just wandered around the city, mostly looking for somewhere
            delicious for dinner. We saw a few beautiful squares, the Trevi Fountain, and ate our very first Itallian pizza for
            dinner, followed closely by our very first Itallian gelato. As you can tell, I was in heaven.</p>

            </div>
          <p>The next day, we did a walking tour of the Vatican, including the personal art collection, St. Peters Basillica, and
            the Sistine Chapel. More photos of this can be found in the gallery below, but one thing I did want to show here is this
            (very blurry and terribly angled) picture of The School of Athens, which is one of my most favorite paintings. It was
            painted by Raphael between 1509 and 1511 at the comission of Pope Julius II. It was meant to have all the great
            scientists, mathemeticions, and philosophers of the time in it. As a little homage to himself, Raphael painted himself
            into the bottom right corner of the picture. I think that is the funniest thing to happen in a Renaissance painting, and
            makes me think Raphael would have been a pretty funny guy.</p>
          <p>The rest of our time in Rome was spent wandering the streets again. My mom was really into Angels and Demons at the time,
            so we did our own walking tour of the REAL LIFE PLACES that were in the movie. My favorite thing that happened on this
            leg of the trip was on my birthday the hotel gifted me a bottle of Champagne (since the legal drinking age there is 16).
            As people who don't consume alcohol, we opened it up and drumped half of it down the toilet so we wouldn't look rude.</p>
          <p>After Rome, we head off to Piza for a day and then Florence for a day. Stay tuned for more posts ! I am so excited !!! </p>
