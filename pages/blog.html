        <h1>Becoming a Travel Blogger</h1>
        <div class="words">
          <p>As a Senior studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University, I didn't really expect myself to become so invested in
            traveling and documenting my experiences. I suppose that was just me falling into the steryotype of my major (you know, sits
            in a dark room all day staring at my computer while the terminal runs all this green text like crazy). But since I have been
            fortunate enough to have lots of opportunities to see many different parts of the world, I felt like it would be a nice creative
            outlet to share those experienes with the internet.</p>
          <p>While most of my traveling has been in the good ole USA, I have also had many opportunities to travel internationally with my
            parents. The first of these trips was to Italy, then Thailand, then South Africa. I will be making more posts about those in the
            coming weeks.</p>
          <p>For me, traveling is a way to appreciate the beauty of the planet we live on, as while as learn about the way other people
            live. I grew up in Seattle, WA, and I have definitely been spoiled by natures beauty. But I grew up surrounded by people who
            were, for the most part, of my same racial, socio-ecomimic, and religious background. This didn't give much opportunity to
            learn about people who are different from me, and I think that fact lead to a very narrow perspective of the world for the first
            16 years of my life.</p>
          <p>However, I have now seen many beautiful things, as well as many eye opening things in our world. I feel such an increased sense of
            gratitute for the things that have been given to me simply because of where I was born and who I was born to. It reminds me that we
            don't deserve anything we have in this life, and it is our job to give back more than we take</p>
